# User Management System

This project is a **User Management System** designed for institutions to handle their users from a single platform. The system allows for efficient management of user data, providing a central point for managing user roles, permissions, and other administrative tasks. The system is built with a **Django** backend and a **React** frontend, integrated using **REST APIs** to ensure seamless communication between the server and client.

## Features
- Centralized user management for institutions.
- Role-based access control and permission management.
- REST API integration between the backend and frontend for seamless data transfer.
- Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Easy-to-extend and maintain codebase.

## Backend (Django)

The backend is built using the Django framework, which handles the server-side logic, database management, and API creation for the system.

### Getting Started (Backend)

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   cd your-project/backend
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the Database**
   Apply migrations to set up the database schema.
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Run the Development Server**
   Start the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. **Access the Admin Panel**
   To manage users from the Django admin interface, create a superuser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
   Then, access the admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`.

## Frontend (React)

The frontend is built using React, which provides a responsive and interactive interface for managing users.

### Getting Started (Frontend)

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Install all required dependencies for the React application:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**
   Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Integration

The Django backend and React frontend communicate through a REST API. All data-related operations, such as creating, updating, or deleting users, are performed via API calls. The backend exposes these APIs, and the frontend makes HTTP requests to manage user data in real-time.

Ensure the backend is running before using the frontend for API interactions.
